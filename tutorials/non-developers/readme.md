## Quick Tutorials.
If you want to directly execute the Command, please follow the steps below:

### 1st Simulation
We're going to publish a post *WITHOUT* :
1) *.acc file

2) *.post file

So, we have to use several parameters when executing a command. Take your attention carefully onwards.

Within Command Prompt we just execute:

```
> socnetsdk.exe –path=C:\mysocnet –account=your@home.com,kunci1234,facebook –post=cool
```

If you want to post containing spaces take a look:

```
> socnetsdk.exe –path=C:\mysocnet –account=your@home.com,kunci1234,facebook –post="know how to do automation? Check our work at domain-bla-bla.com"
```

Simple & straight forward, Am I right?
